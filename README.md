# CS305_Mod5
CS 305 Module 5 Assignment
This project is subject to change. But the general idea is to create a discord bot 
that will update members of a channel about the level progess that players are making
in the game, Old School Runescape.

## Details
Runescape is an old school MMORPG that takes little to no resources to run and is fun to play with friends. It has quite the learning curve and will take too much time to complete.

# Menu Mechanics
The player will be able to press the ESC key on their keyboard and an interactive menu will pop-up on their screen. This menu will have "Continue","Settings", and "Exit" buttons.
